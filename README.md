## Data-Engineering-Challenge
Take home assignment based on Demyst Python libraries

## Business Prompt
A prospective client has provided you with an input file that contains a list of addresses. They are exploring whether external data would be useful for their business problems associated with the addresses. Their business problems include everything from markting to risk evaluation. Demyst wants to send them a wide range of data to show how the value of gathering data from numerous sources via Demyst. 

## Description
In this challenge you will have show understanding of APIs and knowledge of Python, data cleaning and analysis skills, and communication skills.

You will have to to use our Analytics Python package to enrich data, use Pandas, Python, and other Python libraries of your choice to clean and analyze the data, and write sample messages explaining the process to a prospective client. 

The documentation for our API is available at https://demyst.com/docs/python-install. Additionally, you can also login to our platform through the [website](https://demyst.com/) where you will find our data catalog. This catalog is also available through the Python package.

## Requirement
Perform three sub-tasks for submission:

### Analyze and clean the input file using Python/Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook
Draft a message that you would send to the client confirming the characteristics of the file and identifying any issues with the data they provided. Save a cleaned version of input file and the notebook that you used to clean the file to this repo.

### Enrich the input file with multiple sources from the Demyst Catalog
Enrich the cleaned input with external data from at least 3 providers available on the platform. Generate a report that showcases benefits of using multiple sources, e.g. the increase in fill rate of certain attributes. Save that report, along with a summary "email" that you would send to a client explaining the results in the repo. The report should be a PDF and the "email" should be a separate text file. 

### Save the raw data in several formats
  1) One wide file with all sources in a single file: in CSV, JSON, and Parquet format.
  2) Separated into multiple files, one for each source used: zip of CSVs and Excel with multiple tabs.
  
  Save all of these as well as the notebook used for creating them to the repo. 

## Evaluation
- Data scrubbing: 25% Steps taken to clean data and possibility of automating the cleansing step through scripts.
- Insights: 25% Clear messaging to the client and creativity in finding data insights.
- File Types: 25% Accuracy of each required file format saved.
- Coding style: 25% Ease of maintenance; terseness; use of best practices; leverage latest technologies / libraries / clever coding techniques; etc. Appropriate choice of 3rd party libraries or frameworks is encouraged.
